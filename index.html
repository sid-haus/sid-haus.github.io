        <h1>About</h1>
          <div id=”aboutMe”>
              <p>
                Who am I? I’m a <b>student</b> at <b>Rutgers University</b> (Class of 2019, SAS Honors Program), majoring in BAIT (Business Analytics, Information Technology) and Supply Chain Management. 
                <br> But you’re probably saying that you could’ve just gone on to my LinkedIn Page and found that. That’s not why you’re here. <br>
                You’re here because you want to see what kind of person I really am. <br> And the truth is, I’m human.
                I’ve made mistakes, but I have also had the pleasure of getting wonderful opportunities from interesting people,
                making some of the best friends that I could hope for, and receiving help from admirable mentors.
                <br>What has all of this done for me? It has taught me to learn from my mistakes.
                It has made me a meticulous planner, afforded me with a sense of honesty and humility (to certain limits)
                , and made me and all around great person to have a cup of coffee with. 
                <br> I have a clear focus on what I want to do in life. But I also have an eclectic set of passions. Here are just some of the things that I can do/have done. <br>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Web Development
                  <li>App Development
                  <li>Journalism
                  <li>Analysis of Digital Technology/Disruptive Change
                  </ul>
                <br>One more thing—I love experimenting! Designing, YouTubing, Cooking, Tutoring, Plumbing (Unsuccessfully, sorry parents!), Building/Tinkering with computers, Rooting (Android devices, not teeth), and living life to the max. 
                <br>Basically, I want to matter. Have an adventure. Bask in the rays of beautiful design and art. Work on revolutionary ideas and products.
                <br> Think you like me? Want to work with me to achieve our dreams?
